# Comprehensive Plan for Comedy Bar Booking & Ordering System

## Overview
This project will add a dual system for a comedy bar: an online booking system for table reservations and show tickets, and an ordering system for food and drinks. The system will be built using Next.js with the App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, ensuring a modern, clean, and responsive design.

## Architecture & Dependencies
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes with robust error handling and input validation using try/catch and zod.
- **Database (Optional):** Integration via Prisma in a new file (`src/lib/db.ts`) for persistent storage (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production).
- **Authentication (Optional):** Integration using NextAuth.js (if user login is required).
- **Payment Integration (Stub):** Future integration with Stripe API for payment processing.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Consider SSE/WebSockets for live order status updates.

## File & Code Changes

### API Endpoints
- **File:** `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`
  - Create a route handler supporting POST (to create bookings) and GET (to fetch current bookings).
  - Validate inputs (date, time, guest count) using zod; wrap logic in try/catch blocks.
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors).

- **File:** `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`
  - Create a route handler for POST (to create orders) and GET (to list orders).
  - Validate order data (menu items, quantities, total) and handle errors with proper status codes.
  - Consider future integration with payment processing.

### UI Pages
- **File:** `src/app/booking/page.tsx`
  - Build a modern booking interface using Tailwind CSS for layout, spacing, and typography.
  - Integrate an interactive calendar (using react-day-picker) for date selection; include form fields for time, guest count, and table/show selection.
  - Implement client-side validation using react-hook-form and zod; display error messages clearly.

- **File:** `src/app/ordering/page.tsx`
  - Create an ordering page with a grid layout presenting menu items.
  - Each menu item card includes a title, description, price, and a placeholder image using:
    ```jsx
    <img src="https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Delicious+menu+item+display" alt="Delicious menu item display with modern layout and clear typography" onError="this.onerror=null;this.src='fallback-url';" />
    ```
  - Include cart management UI for quantity updates, order summary, and a submission button with clear call-to-action styling.

### Components
- **File:** `src/components/BookingForm.tsx`
  - Encapsulate the booking form fields, validation, and submission logic; reuse in `booking/page.tsx`.
- **File:** `src/components/OrderForm.tsx`
  - Create a reusable component for presenting the menu, handling user selection, and managing the cart.
- **File:** `src/components/OrderStatusCard.tsx`
  - Provide a visual representation of order progress/status with a modern, minimal design.

### Supporting Files
- **File:** `src/lib/db.ts`
  - (Optional) Setup a database connection using Prisma with error handling for connection failures.
- **Authentication (Optional):**
  - Create or update `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` for NextAuth integration if user login is needed.

## Best Practices & Error Handling
- Use try/catch in all API endpoints and validate using zod schemas.
- Apply proper TypeScript typings to API request bodies and responses.
- Ensure responsive design with Tailwind utility classes and avoid third-party icon libraries by relying on clean typography, spacing, and minimal visuals.
- Write clear error messages and log errors for debugging.

## API Testing & Integration
- Validate API endpoints using curl:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date": "2023-10-10", "time": "19:00", "guestCount": 4}'
  ```
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items": [{"id": 1, "quantity": 2}], "total": 29.99}'
  ```
- Update navigation in your main layout (e.g., `src/app/layout.tsx`) to include links to `/booking` and `/ordering`.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Use a modern, minimalistic style: large headers, generous spacing, and a clear visual hierarchy.
- Ensure the booking form and ordering interface are mobile-responsive.
- Provide clear feedback on form submission, validation errors, and successful API responses.
- Use placeholder images only for essential visual elements; maintain layout integrity even if images fail to load.

## Summary
- Added two new API endpoints (`/api/bookings` and `/api/orders`) with robust error handling and validation.
- Developed modern, responsive UI pages for booking and ordering, incorporating interactive calendars and grid layouts.
- Created reusable components for forms and order status displays.
- Planned optional integration with Prisma for database and NextAuth for authentication.
- Designed a clean, minimal, typography-focused UI without third-party icon libraries.
- Included detailed curl command tests for API validation.
- Emphasized robust error handling, TypeScript type safety, and clear user feedback.
- Outlined future payment integration and real-time order tracking plans.
